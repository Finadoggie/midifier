API that transposes WAV files to MIDI.

Created for Chico ACM Fall 2025 Hackathon.

---

This project is nothing to write home about. 
It was made for a 2-week hackathon, and can charitably be described as functional.

Creating it was my first time working with servers, period. 
It was originally hosted on the cheapest server I could find, a VPS located in Moscow costing around $1.06/month. 
Most of my time was spent just finding and setting up a server.
I ended up settling on nginx for the project

Around 2 days were allocated to the actual project.
It was built in Node.js because it looked fairly easy.
I originally considered making it in C, but figuring that out would've been far too much work for a hackathon.

The idea was based on a Youtube video I watched years ago talking about sound waves and fourier transforms.
I had very little actual idea what I was doing, and given how pressed I was for time, I can't say I did a great job on the whole conversion front.

However, I still consider this project a success.
Creating it forced me to learn a fair bit about working with servers.
The knowledge I gained will certainly benefit my future projects.
